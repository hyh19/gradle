## [Installation](https://gradle.org/install/)

Gradle runs on all major operating systems and requires only a Java JDK or JRE version 7 or higher to be installed. To check, run `java -version`:

```
$ java -version
java version "1.8.0_121"
```

### Install with a package manager

[SDKMAN!](http://sdkman.io/) is a tool for managing parallel versions of multiple Software Development Kits on most Unix-based systems.

```
$ sdk install java 8u144-oracle
$ sdk install gradle 4.2.1
```
